Computer Science graduate and Junior Software Developer from Makers with a background in hospitality management. My training at Makers equipped me with essential technical skills such as object-oriented programming, Agile methodologies, and test-driven development, honed through immersive, real-world projects.

Leveraging my prior hospitality experience, I excel in understanding and fulfilling customer needs, translating seamlessly into user-centric software solutions. I'm eager to merge these diverse skill sets into innovative and inclusive projects within the tech landscape.
